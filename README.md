# Nano Flight Recorder

**_This software is experimental and incomplete._**

The software is meant for a small avionics package consisting of:
* Arduino Nano,
* Battery,
* uSD card,
* BMP280 (pressure altimeter),
* MPU9250 (inertial measurement unit).

It records the flight parameters of a model rocket to the SD card.

## TODO
Fix IMU. The code was removed as a dirty-fix to the lack of flash memory. The code should be optimized and inserted back.
